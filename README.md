# Revel Digital MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI assistants with access to the Revel Digital REST API for digital signage management.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. MCP allows AI assistants to access real-time data and perform actions through standardized interfaces.

## How it Works with Revel Digital

This MCP server exposes the Revel Digital REST API as tools that AI assistants can use to manage your digital signage infrastructure. Through natural language commands, you can:

- Manage devices, content, and playlists
- Monitor system status and performance
- Configure schedules and automation
- Access analytics and reporting data

This enables conversational control of your digital signage network, making complex management tasks as simple as describing what you want to accomplish.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher
- A Revel Digital account with API access
- API key or OAuth2 credentials for authentication

         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP server.

### Installing in Other AI Clients
